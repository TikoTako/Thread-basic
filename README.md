# Thread-basic
Testing multi threading stuff.


Project1

    Work i think, but creating too much threads will eat all the virtual memory
    Also on 32bit it crash at 2 gb that is around 1500 threads.



Project2

    Trying with less threads and pulling the data from an array but sometimes work sometimes dont ðŸ˜•
